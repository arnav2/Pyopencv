There are 4 ways to do to create an image search engine 
    Color: Image descriptors that characterize the color of an image seek to model the distribution of the pixel intensities in    each channel of the image. These methods include basic color statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and skewness, along with color histograms, both “flat” and multi-dimensional.
    Texture: Texture descriptors seek to model the feel, appearance, and overall tactile quality of an object in an image. Some, but not all, texture descriptors convert the image to grayscale and then compute a Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and compute statistics over this matrix, including contrast, correlation, and entropy, to name a few. More advanced texture descriptors such as Fourier and Wavelet transforms also exist, but still utilize the grayscale image.
    Shape: Many shape descriptor methods rely on extracting the contour of an object in an image (i.e. the outline). Once we have the outline, we can then compute simple statistics to to characterize the outline, which is exactly what OpenCV’s Hu Moments does. These statistics can be used to represent the shape (outline) of an object in an image.
